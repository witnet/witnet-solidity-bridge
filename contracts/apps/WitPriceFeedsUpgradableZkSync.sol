/// @title WitPriceFeedsUpgradableZkSync: On-demand Price Feeds registry for zkSync-ERA chains,
/// natively powered by the Wit/Oracle blockchain, but yet capable of aggregating 
/// price updates from other on-chain price-feed oracles too, if required.
/// 
/// Price feeds purely relying on the Wit/Oracle present multiple benefits:
/// - Anyone can permissionless pull and report price updates on-chain.
/// - Updating price feeds on-chain requires paying no extra "update fees".
/// - Prices can be extracted from independent and highly reputed exchanges and data providers.
/// - Actual data sources for each price feed can be introspected on-chain.
/// - Data source traceability is possible for every single price update.
///
/// Instances of this contract may also provide support for "routed price feeds" (computed as the 
/// product or mean average of up to other 8 different price feeds), as well as "cascade price feeds" 
/// (where multiple oracles could be used as backup when preferred ones don't manage to provide 
/// fresh enough updates for whatever reason).
///
/// Last but not least, this contract allows simple plug-and-play integration from 
/// smart contracts, dapps and DeFi projects currently adapted to operate with
/// other price feed solutions, like Chainlink, or Pyth. 
///
