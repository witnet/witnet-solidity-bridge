# witnet-solidity-bridge

`witnet/witnet-solidity-bridge` is an open source implementation of an API that enables Solidity smart contract developers to harness the full power of the [**Witnet Decentralized Oracle Network**](https://docs.witnet.io/intro/about/).

This repository provides several deployable contracts:

- `WitnetLib`, helper library useful for parsing Witnet-solved results to previously posted Witnet Data Requests.
- `WitnetProxy`, a delegate-proxy contract that routes Witnet Data Requests to a currently active `WitnetRequestBoard` implementation.
- Multiple implementations of the `WitnetRequestBoard` interface (WRB), which declares all required functionality to relay encapsulated [Witnet Data Requests](https://docs.witnet.io/intro/about/architecture#capabilities-of-data-requests/) from an EVM compatible chain to the Witnet mainnet, as well as to relay Witnet-solved results back to Ethereum.

The repository also provides:

- `UsingWitnet`, an inheritable abstract contract that injects methods for conveniently interacting with the WRB.
- `WitnetRequest`, used as a means to encapsulate unmodifiable Witnet Data Requests.
- `WitnetRequestBase`, useful as a base contract to implement your own modifiable Witnet Data Requests.


## **WitnetProxy**

`WitnetProxy` is an upgradable delegate-proxy contract that routes Witnet Data Requests coming from a `UsingWitnet`-inheriting contract to a currently active `WitnetRequestBoard` implementation. 

To find the entry-point address of the latest deployed version of the `WitnetRequestBoard` contract in every supported chain, please visit the [Witnet Data Feeds Explorer](https://feeds.witnet.io/).

## **IWitnetRequest**

Used as a means to encapsulate Witnet Data Requests, that can eventually be posted to a `WitnetRequestBoard` implementation. The `bytecode()` of a `IWitnetRequest` must be constructed from the CBOR-encoded serialization of a [Witnet Data Request](https://docs.witnet.io/intro/about/architecture#capabilities-of-data-requests/). The `IWitnetRequest` interface defines two methods:

- **`bytecode()`**:
  - _Description_:
    - Returns Witnet Data Request as a CBOR-encoded `bytes`. 

- **`hash()`**:
  - _Description_:
    - Returns SHA256 hash of Witnet Data Request as CBOR-encoded bytes.

## **WitnetRequestBoard**

From the point of view of a `UsingWitnet` contract, any given `WitnetRequestBoard` will always support the following interfaces:

- **`IWitnetRequestBoardEvents`**
- **`IWitnetRequestBoardRequestor`**
- **`IWitnetRequestBoardView`**

### IWitnetRequestBoardEvents:

Besides, your contract will have access to the whole Witnet Request Board functionality by means of the immutable **`witnet`** address field.

## **Usage: harness the power of the Witnet Decentralized Oracle Network**

In order to integrate your own smart contracts with the **Witnet** fully-decentralized blockchain, you just need to inherit from the `UsingWitnet` abstract contract:

```solidity
pragma solidity >=0.7.0 <0.9.0;

import "./UsingWitnet.sol";

contract MyContract is UsingWitnet {
  IWitnetRequest myRequest;

  constructor() UsingWitnet(/* here comes the entrypoint address provided by the Witnet Foundation */) {
    // TODO
  }

  function myOwnDrPost() public payable returns (uint256 _drTrackId) {
    _drTrackId = witnetPostRequest{value: msg.value}(myRequest);
  }
}
```

Please, have a look at the [`witnet/truffle-box`](https://github.com/witnet/truffle-box) repository to learn how to compose your own `IWitnetRequest` contracts.
